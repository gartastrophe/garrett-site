										To whomever has reached this page,
									</p>
									<p>
										You are presumably here because you are interested in hiring me. If you are mostly just 
										looking for a list of my work experience and skills, you can browse my 
										<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/garrett-compston-87571322a" 
										target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> 
										and take a look at my 
										<a href="images/resume.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resume</a>. 
										However, these are a rather limited snapshot of my 
										life and experiences, so if you are interested, this space will be for a more animated 
										discussion of these things providing, perhaps, a more nuanced view of myself.

										<h3>About me</h3>
										<p>
											First, a brief introduction of myself in a general sense. I am currently a student at 
											Northeastern University, taking combined studies in computer science and music technology. 
											My mom enrolled me in a ‘Computers for Kids’ class at the age of three, and around that 
											same time, I started singing along to whatever CDs my dad put on in the car, so this 
											combination could be seen as a bit of a foregone conclusion. I haven’t been able to pick 
											a single interest in my life either, which could be the cause of the combination major. 
											And while some may see this as a weakness, I take great pride in the myriad of skills I 
											have picked up throughout my life, despite some of these skills’ perceived usefulness. 
											In addition, I have at least seen some need to specialize, again, through combination, 
											settling on digital signal processing. It began with an interest in audio signals, and 
											expanded to many others, the main signals driving the expansion being radio. This was 
											first spurred on by joining the student broadcast station at Northeastern, WRBB, and 
											subsequently the amateur radio club, W1KBN, and then getting licensed myself, having now 
											upgraded to the amateur extra class. I am innately curious about just about everything, 
											so I rarely get bored in a role.
										</p>
									</section>
									<section id="skills">
										<h3>Skills</h3>
										<p>
											I have a number of programming languages that I can utilize with varying degrees of fluency. 
											C and C++ are my main languages, which I started using with more frequency with my interest 
											in audio processing. I am also familiar with Java from my coursework, C# from scripting within 
											Unity, HTML and CSS from personal web design, and Python which I’ve used on and off for quick 
											scripting ever since I first started learning to program.
										</p>
										<p>
											I have also been granted a number of skills from interests, hobbies, and occasionally classes. 
											I am familiar with RF and RF design from my involvement with amateur radio and broadcast radio 
											at Northeastern and in my personal time. Both of these have also given me a working 
											understanding of networks. Branching into music technology skills; I have a good understanding 
											of acoustic principles, I’ve never been able to settle on a DAW so I can use just about any 
											that is set in front of me with proficiency given time, and I’ve worked enough live and 
											recording setups to know one end of an XLR cable from the other. On the programming side, 
											I am familiar with Max/MSP, openPD, and the JUCE framework.

										<h3>Work Experience</h3>
										<h2 style="font-size: x-large;">WRBB 104.9 FM</h2>
										<h1><i>October 2021 - Present</i></h1>
										<p>
											I have done a lot of jobs at WRBB. I started on the tech team (which was officially 
											reformed the semester that I joined), and soon after became a DJ and began acting 
											as assistant technical director. In the summer of 2022, I started working as assistant 
											programming director and eventually took over the position in January of 2023. I held 
											the position for a year, making significant changes to the scheduling process and aiding 
											in the transition to a new studio in the fall of 2023. I relinquished the position in 
											January of 2024 to ensure that the changes that I had made would be effective for the 
											people coming after me. At this time, I am continuing to DJ and help with technical 
											challenges. 
										</p>
										<h2 style="font-size: x-large;">RF Venue</h2>
										<h1><i>January 2024 - June 2024</i></h1>
										<p>
											RF Venue was my first official Northeastern co-op, and I was also the first co-op that 
											the company had taken on. Since my leaving, they were happy enough with my work that 
											they have decided to continue with hiring co-ops from Northeastern. Due to my highly 
											interdisciplinary background, I ended up doing a number of jobs during my time at RF Venue. 
											If you are unfamiliar with the company, they mainly make antennas and distribution systems 
											for wireless microphones and IEMs. As such, my combination of knowledge in both audio and 
											radio was very helpful. I completed a number of quality assurance tasks for some of the 
											products which were in development at the time, namely the Combine 6 and the Spectrum 
											Recorder. However, I also completed a number of data processing and visualization tasks 
											for the sales team, as well as helped to create educational content for marketing. All in 
											all, I enjoyed my time during the co-op and I appreciate all of the different roles I was 
											able to explore.

										<h3>Personal Projects</h3>
										<h2 style="font-size: x-large;">Analog Synthesizer Composition and Sound Design</h2>
										<h1><i>Completed December 2022</i></h1>
										<p>
											This project was completed for my Intro to Music Technology course at Northeastern. 
											The project was a deep dive into the controls and sound design of analog synthesizers. 
											The intention was a better understanding of the audio effects that we have access to 
											in an analog space. I personally became infatuated with the Oberheim OB-X synthesizer, 
											but, without a spare $6k lying around, chose the wonderful free emulation, OB-Xd by 
											discoDSP. I chose to create a horror soundtrack to fully explore the stranger, grittier 
											sounds that an analog synth is great at. My professor, Victor Zappi, made the comment 
											that the sound of the final product is very similar to 80s horror films, as many of their 
											soundtracks were made in the exact fashion as I made mine, with every sound in the 
											composition being created by the synth. You can listen to the compositions at the 
											following links: 
											<a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LCRxgrSeMGxwJJGFNPJVHZzss3g-Y8ZV/view?usp=drive_link

											<a href= https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KLCmakr9aM7k_kwyjfXiuccNeideXM3n/view?usp=drive_link
											target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Signal</a>.
										</p>
										<h2 style="font-size: x-large;">Photo Editing Suite</h2>
										<h1><i>Completed April 2023</i></h1>
										<p>
											This was a project for my Object Oriented Design course at Northeastern. I completed it 
											alongside my partner on the project and my friend, Eddy Liu. We both contributed to the 
											overall design. Eddy’s focus was much more on the applied effects on imported images 
											while I spent more time with the UI elements. The code for this project is linked on my 
											GitHub <a href=https://github.com/gartastrophe/photo-editor 
											target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
										</p>

										<h2 style="font-size: x-large;">Mandalorian Armor Senior Project</h2>
										<h1><i>Completed May 2021</i></h1>
										<p>
											My senior year of high school was weird. Let’s just start with that. I graduated in 2021 
											to make things abundantly clear. However, I was able to pursue a senior project in the 
											last couple months of my senior year. I was rather enamored with 3D printing at the time 
											(still am) and wanted to do a project for that. I had found a model for a Mandalorian 
											helmet online and decided I’d model the rest of the armor myself for the project. 
											My project advisor, Mr. Brown (who was also my physics and engineering teacher) and I had 
											to pitch this in a way that still sounded educational, so we said it was to learn rapid 
											prototyping. And you know what? It really was. I walked away quite proficient with 
											Fusion360 and with an honest to god understanding of why it takes so long to bring a 
											product from conception to version final. I created a google site 
											<a href=https://sites.google.com/view/gcompston-senior-project/home
											target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(linked here)</a> back when I completed the 
											project to log my progress. I am still particularly proud of the vambraces. The pauldrons 
											could use some work, but in my defense, my understanding of 3D modeling was not one that 
											often took into account the human body (not really a free draw tool user) so it kinda 
											makes sense that they didn’t fit my shoulders. Overall, I still like this insight into 
											where I was back in high school. 
										</p>
										<h3>Other people’s projects I’ve worked on</h3>
										<h2 style="font-size: x-large;">Sound Recording for "Egress" Short Film</h2>
										<h1><i>Premiered April 2024</i></h1>
										<p>
											Roshni Subramonian, a producer/director friend of mine asked me if I would help with 
											sound recording for a short film they were working on. That shoot ended up being the 
											short film “Egress”. I worked on all of the on-location recording. You can 
											<a href=https://youtu.be/y8lpCNwHyCg?si=VULekNFdD4gksa-z
											target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watch it on YouTube</a> which has the full 
											cast and crew credits in the description. 
										</p>
										<h2 style="font-size: x-large;">Talk Sick Violin Recording</h2>
										<h1><i>Releases in 2022 and 2024</i></h1>
										<p>
											My friend Josh Tochner goes under the artist name 
											<a href=https://open.spotify.com/artist/6veWWBHCx8rKZohP5MWFxu
											target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Talk Sick</a>
											and makes some awesome music. I’ve actually gotten to record some violin for a couple 
											of his tracks, 
											<a href=https://open.spotify.com/track/21Dr6sjGn0f6JnyWenQiJs?si=529a942d60784421
											target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Scared of Nothing"</a> 
											and 
											<a href=https://open.spotify.com/track/40AZFabEAWEnJEuWuf275W?si=572f24373b5a4f8f
											target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Tell Myself"</a>. 
											Go take a listen!
