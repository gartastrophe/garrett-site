										Roshni Subramonian, a producer/director friend of mine asked me if I would help with

										short film “Egress”. I worked on all of the on-location recording. You can

									<h2>
										Analog Synthesizer Composition and Sound Design
									</h2>
									<h1><i>Completed December 2022</i></h1>
									<p>
										This project was completed for my Intro to Music Technology course at Northeastern. 
										The project was a deep dive into the controls and sound design of analog synthesizers. 
										The intention was a better understanding of the audio effects that we have access to 
										in an analog space. I personally became infatuated with the Oberheim OB-X synthesizer, 
										but, without a spare $6k lying around, chose the wonderful free emulation, OB-Xd by 
										discoDSP. I chose to create a horror soundtrack to fully explore the stranger, grittier 
										sounds that an analog synth is great at. My professor, Victor Zappi, made the comment 
										that the sound of the final product is very similar to 80s horror films, as many of their 
										soundtracks were made in the exact fashion as I made mine, with every sound in the 
										composition being created by the synth. You can listen to the compositions at the 
										following links:
