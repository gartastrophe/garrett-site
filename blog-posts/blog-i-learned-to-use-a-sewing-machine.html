										<h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">I learned to use a sewing machine</h2>
										<h3>a reflection on self-reliance</h3>
										<h1>July 24, 2024 <br> <br> </h1>
									</header>
									<p>
										Yesterday, I completed a training in the Northeastern EXP Makerspace. The training 
										covered using the sewing machines and the serger and now I am allowed to use these machines 
										with no oversight. I’ve used a sewing machine before and I understand them vaguely, and 
										they had the option to test out of it without taking a training, but it was nice to be 
										walked through by someone who really knew what they were doing (thank you Aya!). Now, the 
										EXP makerspace has a TON of stuff to use like 3D printers, soldering stations, things that 
										would be expected to captivate the interest of a STEM-oriented student such as myself. My 
										first choice was sewing machines.										
									</p>
									<p>
										Now, there are perhaps other reasons for why I didn’t immediately jump on certifications 
										for some of these other tools. Some of them, like soldering, I don’t particularly need since 
										I already have access to spaces where I can solder to my heart’s content. But I had a more 
										ideological reason for wanting to sew, and a lot of it has to do with my love of doing things 
										yourself.
									</p>
									<p>
										I learned to hand sew back in high school for a costume. I was sewing velcro onto fabric. It 
										was trivial, I could’ve done it with adhesive, but I wanted to sew it mostly because I wanted 
										to learn how to sew. I don’t know why I had that urge back then, but I’ve certainly started 
										to contextualize these things more now. Now, it seems like an instance of wanting autonomy, 
										wanting to do it myself. I think more people should want to do things themselves.
									</p>
									<p>
										We are in an age of convenience. If you can think of it, you can probably also order it 
										directly to your doorstep. Now, I’m too young to truly remember a time in my life where this 
										wasn’t the case. Yet, I’m still a bit put off by this. I think I get called an ‘old soul’ too 
										often for my own tastes, but this is one where I’ll take it on the nose. I’m not put off by 
										the idea of convenience. I think it is a wonderful thing, and I will take advantage of it 
										readily. However, I think that over-reliance can cause complacency.
									</p>
									<p>
										I ripped my jacket open at the armpit last November. Nice jacket, though I got it cheap, 
										Levi Strauss, duck canvas exterior, I really like that jacket. Maybe I could’ve found the 
										same jacket again online (although nowadays, even that’s gotten harder to do) but what a waste, 
										right? That’s a great jacket and it even ripped right along the seam, so it wouldn’t even be a 
										tough fix. So I hand sewed it back up. Lasted the rest of the winter, and is still going strong. 
										I’m excited to wear it again this coming winter, in fact.
									</p>
									<p>
										What did this gain me? Anywhere from $80-$140 by my guess of what that jacket actually retails 
										for. Pride in a job well done. The satisfaction of not having to toss that jacket in a 
										landfill. The autonomy to not have to rely on a corporation to have a suitable replacement for 
										my favorite jacket.
									</p>
									<p>
										I trained on the sewing machines because I expect to use them in a way that is meaningful to 
										simply living my life. Oh, the 3D printers, laser cutters, and CNC mills are wonderful, and 
										have the potential for nearly limitless creation and innovation. And even those sewing machines 
										can be used to create some fantastic things. But for me, they bring a kind of satisfaction that 
										can only be found in that lovely autonomy. Do it yourself.
